### Logistic Regression
Strengths include high interpretability, fast training, and low inference cost.
It performs well on linearly separable data but struggles with complex patterns.

### Random Forest
Offers strong performance on tabular data with moderate interpretability.
Training and inference costs are higher, making it less suitable for low-latency systems.

### XGBoost
Delivers high accuracy and handles complex non-linear relationships effectively.
However, it requires careful tuning, longer training time, and sacrifices explainability.
