You are acting as a referee, not a decision-maker.

Based on the constraints provided, give conditional guidance:

- If interpretability is the top priority, explain which model fits best and why.
- If accuracy is the top priority, explain which model fits best and why.
- If low training cost is the priority, explain which model fits best and why.
- If low-latency deployment is required, explain which model fits best and why.

Do NOT give a final answer.
Present trade-offs clearly.
